## Features

- [x] Extract all files from a directory tree into a single folder
- [x] Organize files by extension

## Installation 

   1. Download the installer <a href="https://github.com/pzzzl/p55/raw/master/installer.zip">here</a> 
   2. Run the installer and follow the steps until it's finished
   3. Run `P55.exe`

## How it works?

### Extract

Imagine you have the following folder structure:

```
C:\USERS\YOUR_NAME\DESKTOP\EXTRACTABLE_FOLDER
│   file_1.txt
│   file_2.txt
│
├───subfolder_1
│       file_3.txt
│       file_4.txt
│
└───subfolder_2
    │   file_5.txt
    │
    └───subfolder_3
            file_6.txt
            file_7.txt
```

It would be an extensive work to search into your tree moving those files to another "extracted" folder, <b>one by one, folder by folder</b>.

Your goal would be something like that:

```
C:\USERS\YOUR_NAME\DESKTOP\EXTRACTABLE_FOLDER
├───extracted
│       file_1.txt
│       file_2.txt
│       file_3.txt
│       file_4.txt
│       file_5.txt
│       file_6.txt
│       file_7.txt
│
├───subfolder_1
└───subfolder_2
    └───subfolder_3
```

The better way to do this is by using <b><i>P55</i></b>, making that task <i>easy as 1-2-3</i>.

### Organize

## Advice 
  The best way to work with files is <b>ALWAYS</b> by making them safe first. To guarantee data loss prevention, make sure you have a backup before running the script. The code is projected to not allow those things to happen, but you'll never know. Enjoy! 😀
